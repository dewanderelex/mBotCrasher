### Good morning, today I want to introduce to you guys reality game with my own embed system on the Arduino based car. The game is called “mBot crasher arcade.” My embedded system on the car involve the active use of sensors (line following, ultrasonic, and infrared) and devices (led, sound, and motor). It also optimizes the use of mathematics with the appearance of sigmoid function. But first, let’s talk about the rule of the game.

### In order to implement your own system into the mBot and test it out, follow these step:

- Download makeblock program from this [link](https://www.mblock.cc/en-us/download/)
- Import the file .mblock into the program by using File -> Import from this computer
- Connect to your mBot and click upload.
- Have fun.
